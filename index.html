        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Born in Poland in 1997</li>
            <li> Graduated from Queens technical and Vocational Highschool <br>(now Queens Technical High School)</li>
            <li> Both me and my brother graduated from this school from the graphic design program</li>
            <li> I am in the SVA program. This is a program that take students out of CTE high schools and helps them become teachers of their respective trade.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why did I become a teacher</h2>
        <p> I became a teacher by joining the SVA program. Although the way I joined the program was very different from other people. Instead of joining the program right away, I first went to City College to get a Digital Media Degree. Two years into that degree, I had a panic attack about getting a career in the industry and decided to get a minor in education, as a backup. My first education class had a project where I had to go observe a school and record my findings about the demographics of the school and area. That is when Mr. Garcia told me to join the SVA program and make education my primary and design as my backup.
        </p>
